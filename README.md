Trying to create a fully automated and AI-generated YouTube channel! :)

- webscraper for subreddits ✅
- auto-scrape images off of popular reddit posts ✅
- download text from popular reddit posts and top five upvoted comments ✅
- create voiceover using ai ✅
- create captions ⏳
- add gameplay in the background ⏳
- patch temp files together into a single mp4 ✅
- auto-upload to youtube a few times a day ⏳

This is my version of claritycoders' original idea, their info:
