About 99% of the jobs posted on their websites (the company owned about 35 web domains) and shared on other websites are fake. The marketing and SEO department was tasked in creating super optimized job listings, that out performed real job listings. To apply to these job listings, you would have to register an account. This would inflate our candidate database and we would have loads of CVs. The sales team would then take this information and contact companies to get them to pay to put their open vacancies on our websites, because we had one of the largest candidate databases. I remember getting so annoyed by this practice I started reporting these vacancies as fake, even on LinkedIn. But LinkedIn rejected my report saying it was legitimate. It wasn’t, and I know this because I created that fake vacancy.\n\nWhat makes this even more alarming, is that so many recruitment companies do this. If you want to apply for a job, you’re better off going to that companies website instead and not using a third party. I left that place and swore I would never work in recruitment again.', 'best_reply': 'MIA'}, {'id': '1enhwhm', 'title': 'What kind of sport is more likely to destroy your health rather than improve it?', 'image_path': None, 'Best_comment': 'In reality, when you get to the point of playing at a professional or semi-pro level, most sports take a crazy toll on your body.', 'best_reply': 'MIA'}, {'id': '1entyh5', 'title': 'Which ingredient will instantly make you go "nope" no matter how tasty the food seems?', 'image_path': None, 'Best_comment': 'Brains.', 'best_reply': 'MIA'}]
